            <h2>Asheville Democratic Socialists Endorse Dee Williams for City Council</h2>
            <p>Asheville, N.C. Sept. 13 2017— The Asheville Chapter of the Democratic Socialist of America has endorsed Dee Williams as a candidate for Asheville City Council. She received the most support in a vote by DSA members that followed a packed September 13 Asheville DSA City Council Candidate Forum at the Haywood Road branch of the public library.</p>
            <p>More than 100 people attended to hear candidates Rich Lee, Cecil Bothwell, Sheneika E. Smith, Dee Williams, Kim Roney and Jan (Howard) Kubiniec discuss a wide range of issues including affordability, the housing crisis, educational disparities, access to abortion and health services, racist policing, the environment and LGBTQIA+ rights.</p>
            <p>The endorsement ballot utilized the Borda count method with each member able to choose and rank their top three choices. First choice received three points, second received two and third received one. Then, the points for each candidate were totalled, and the endorsed candidate was the one that received the most points. Dee Williams finished first, followed by Rich Lee in second and Kim Roney in third.</p>
            <p>DSA members are welcome to personally support and help any campaign or candidate however the local chapter will limit its efforts to helping elect Dee Williams, our endorsed candidate.</p>
            <p>"Dee Williams displayed a fighter’s spirit, and a willingness to challenge the status quo and find creative solutions to the city's most pressing issues," says Noah Hall, a DSA member who threw his support behind Williams. "I hope she brings that activist approach to City Council."</p>
            <p>Asheville DSA thanks all the candidates that participated in last night’s forum. We also thank members of the public who brought thoughtful questions to the discussion.</p>
